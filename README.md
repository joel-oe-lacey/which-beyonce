Which muffin is a concentration style game aimed at building upon layers of interactivity and responsiveness. The initial comp is designed for a matching game featuring Beyonce, this version looks to demonstrate human superiority against AI in identifying between muffins and chihuahuas:

## Result
The page is fairly responsive and adapts to regular, larger and tablet sized screens. It has several layers of functionality for users to input name with persistence of user names and round results. The matching itself is dynamic with a new shuffle on each round.
